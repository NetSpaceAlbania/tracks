<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Binaries and configs</h1><br/><pre>binaries and config files, including their role in system administration:<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">- **Binaries**</span>: Binaries are executable files that contain machine code and are compiled from source code. They are used to run applications, system-level tasks, and scripts. Binaries can be stored in different directories on the system, depending on their purpose. For example:<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">  - </span><span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/bin`</span>: This directory contains essential binaries that are required for booting the system and running system-level commands. These binaries are often used in shell scripts to perform system tasks.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">  - </span><span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/usr/bin`</span>: This directory contains non-essential binaries that are installed by the operating system or by third-party applications. These binaries are often used to run applications and perform user-level tasks.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">  - </span><span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/sbin`</span>: This directory contains system-level binaries that are used for system administration tasks, such as mounting file systems and configuring network interfaces.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">  - </span><span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/usr/sbin`</span>: This directory contains non-essential system-level binaries that are installed by the operating system or by third-party applications.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">  - </span><span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/usr/local/bin`</span> and <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/usr/local/sbin`</span>: These directories contain locally-installed binaries that are not part of the operating system or any package manager. These binaries are often used by system administrators to install and run custom scripts and applications.<br /><br />System administrators use binaries extensively in their work to manage and maintain a system. For example, they may use the <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`ls`</span> command to list files in a directory, the <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`ps`</span> command to view running processes, or the <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`top`</span> command to monitor system performance.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">- **Config Files**</span>: Config files contain settings and configuration information for various system components, such as the kernel, networking, and system services. They are used to configure the behavior of system components and applications. Config files can be stored in different directories on the system, depending on their purpose. For example:<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">  - </span><span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/etc`</span>: This directory contains system-wide configuration files for various components, such as the kernel, network configuration, system services, and user accounts. System administrators use config files in <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/etc`</span> to configure system components and services, such as the Apache web server, the SSH daemon, and the firewall.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">  - </span><span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/sysconfig`</span>: This directory is specific to some Linux distributions and contains configuration files for system services, such as the network and firewall. System administrators use config files in <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/sysconfig`</span> to configure system services.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">  - </span><span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/var`</span>: This directory contains variable data that changes frequently, such as log files and spool directories. System administrators use config files in <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/var`</span> to configure log rotation, and to configure applications that use <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/var`</span> for temporary data storage.<br /><br />System administrators use config files extensively in their work to manage and maintain a system. For example, they may use the <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/etc/passwd`</span> file to view user account information, the <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/etc/fstab`</span> file to configure file system mounts, or the <span style="color:#333333;font-weight:400">`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`</span> file to configure the SSH daemon.<br /><br />Overall, binaries and config files are critical components of an operating system, and system administrators use them extensively in their work to manage and maintain a system.</pre></div>
