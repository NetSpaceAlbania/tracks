This is achieved by time-sharing, where the available processor time is divided between multiple processes. These processes are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by a task-scheduling subsystem of the operating system. Multi-tasking may be characterized in preemptive and cooperative types. In preemptive multitasking, the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot to each of the programs. Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux—as well as non-Unix-like, such as AmigaOS—support preemptive multitasking. Cooperative multitasking is achieved by relying on each process to provide time to the other processes in a defined manner. 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows used cooperative multi-tasking; 32-bit versions of both Windows NT and Win9x used preemptive multi-tasking.<br /><br /><span style="color:#7f0044;font-weight:400"># Single- and multi-user</span><br /><br />	<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">**Single-user**</span> operating systems have no facilities to distinguish users but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem. A <span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">**multi-user**</span> operating system extends the basic concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identify processes and resources, such as disk space, belonging to multiple users, and the system permits multiple users to interact with the system at the same time. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources to multiple users.<br /><br /><span style="color:#7f0044;font-weight:400"># Distributed</span><br /><br />	A <span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">**distributed**</span> operating system manages a group of distinct, networked computers and makes them appear to be a single computer, as all computations are distributed (divided amongst the constituent computers).<br /><br /><span style="color:#7f0044;font-weight:400"># Embedded</span><br /><br />	<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">**Embedded**</span> operating systems are designed to be used in embedded computer systems. They are designed to operate on small machines with less autonomy (e.g. PDAs). They are very compact and extremely efficient by design and are able to operate with a limited amount of resources. Windows CE and Minix 3 are some examples of embedded operating systems.<br /><br /><span style="color:#7f0044;font-weight:400"># Real-time</span><br /><br />	A <span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">**real-time**</span> operating system is an operating system that guarantees to process events or data by a specific moment in time. A real-time operating system may be single- or multi-tasking, but when multitasking, it uses specialized scheduling algorithms so that a deterministic nature of behavior is achieved. Such an event-driven system switches between tasks based on their priorities or external events, whereas time-sharing operating systems switch tasks based on clock interrupts.<br /><br /><span style="color:#7f0044;font-weight:400"># Library</span><br /><br />	A <span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:400">**library**</span> operating system is one in which the services that a typical operating system provides, such as networking, are provided in the form of libraries and composed with the application and configuration code to construct a unikernel: a specialized, single address space, machine image that can be deployed to cloud or embedded environments.<br /></pre></div>
