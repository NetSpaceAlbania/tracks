<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>what is shell && Terminal</h1><br/><pre>Shell and terminal are two related but distinct concepts in the world of computing:<br /><br /><span style="color:#7f0044;font-weight:400">## Shell</span><br />A shell is a command-line interface (CLI) that provides a way for users to interact with the operating system and execute commands. The shell interprets the user&#39;s input and executes the corresponding commands. Examples of shells include Bash, Zsh, and Fish.<br /><br /><span style="color:#7f0044;font-weight:400">## Terminal</span><br />A terminal, also known as a terminal emulator, is a program that provides a graphical interface for accessing the shell. The terminal allows the user to type commands and see the output of those commands in a graphical window. The terminal also provides features such as copy and paste, multiple tabs, and customizable settings.<br /><br />In other words, a shell is the program that processes commands and returns output, while a terminal is the program that displays the output of those commands and allows the user to interact with the shell. <br /><br />Here is a table summarizing the differences between the two:<br /><br />| Shell  | Terminal |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| Processes commands and returns output | Displays output and allows interaction with the shell |<br />| Examples include Bash, Zsh, and Fish | Examples include iTerm2, GNOME Terminal, and Windows Terminal |<br />| Can be accessed without a graphical interface | Requires a graphical interface |<br />| Can be run in a terminal or directly in the operating system | Runs within the terminal program |<br /><br />Overall, the shell and terminal are both important components of a command-line interface, with the shell providing the functionality and the terminal providing the interface.</pre></div>
