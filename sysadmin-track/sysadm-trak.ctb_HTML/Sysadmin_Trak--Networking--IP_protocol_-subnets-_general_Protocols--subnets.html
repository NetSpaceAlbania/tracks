<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>subnets</h1><br/>Let&#39;s cover subnetting and how it works:<br /><br />## Subnetting:<br /><br />Subnetting is a technique used to divide a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks or subnets. The primary purpose of subnetting is to improve network efficiency, security, and organization. By dividing a large network into smaller subnets, you can control and manage network traffic more effectively.<br /><br />### How Subnetting Works:<br /><br />1. **IP Address Structure:**<br />   In IP addressing, an IP address consists of two parts: the network portion and the host portion. The network portion identifies the specific network to which a device belongs, while the host portion identifies the individual device within that network.<br /><br />2. **Subnet Mask:**<br />   A subnet mask is a 32-bit value that helps determine the boundary between the network portion and the host portion of an IP address. It works like a filter, separating the bits that represent the network address from those representing the host address.<br /><br />3. **Subnetting Process:**<br />   To subnet a network, you borrow bits from the host portion of the IP address and use them to create a subnet identifier. The remaining bits represent individual devices within each subnet. By doing this, you create smaller, more manageable subnets from the original larger network.<br /><br />4. **Example:**<br />   Let&#39;s take the IP address 192.168.0.0 as an example. In its default configuration, this is considered a single network with all 32 bits representing the network. However, let&#39;s say we decide to subnet this network into smaller subnets. We can use subnet masks with different lengths (denoted by the CIDR notation) to create various subnets.<br /><br />   For instance:<br />   - If we use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 or /24 (in CIDR notation), we get a subnet range of 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255, with 254 possible host addresses in each subnet.<br />   - If we use a subnet mask of 255.255.255.128 or /25, we get two subnets with a range of 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.127 and 192.168.0.128 to 192.168.0.255, with 126 host addresses in each subnet.<br /><br />### Advantages of Subnetting:<br /><br />- **Efficient Use of IP Addresses:** Subnetting allows you to allocate IP addresses more efficiently by avoiding large blocks of unused addresses.<br /><br />- **Improved Network Performance:** Smaller subnets help reduce broadcast traffic, making networks more efficient and responsive.<br /><br />- **Enhanced Network Security:** Subnetting helps isolate different parts of a network, making it harder for unauthorized access to spread to other parts of the network.<br /><br />- **Easier Network Management:** With smaller subnets, network administrators can manage and troubleshoot networks more effectively.<br /><br />Subnetting is a crucial network design technique that plays a significant role in the organization and optimization of IP-based networks. It is widely used in various network environments, from local area networks (LANs) to large-scale enterprise networks and the internet.<br /><br /><br /><table class="table"><tr><th>CIDR</th><th>Subnet mask</th><th>Wildcard mask</th><th># of IP addresses</th><th># of usable IP addresses</th></tr><tr><td>/32</td><td>255.255.255.255</td><td>0.0.0.0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>/31</td><td>255.255.255.254</td><td>0.0.0.1</td><td>2</td><td>2*</td></tr><tr><td>/30</td><td>255.255.255.252</td><td>0.0.0.3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>/29</td><td>255.255.255.248</td><td>0.0.0.7</td><td>8</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>/28</td><td>255.255.255.240</td><td>0.0.0.15</td><td>16</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>/27</td><td>255.255.255.224</td><td>0.0.0.31</td><td>32</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>/26</td><td>255.255.255.192</td><td>0.0.0.63</td><td>64</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>/25</td><td>255.255.255.128</td><td>0.0.0.127</td><td>128</td><td>126</td></tr><tr><td>/24</td><td>2 55.255.255.0</td><td>0.0.0.255</td><td>256</td><td>254</td></tr><tr><td>/23</td><td>255.255.254.0</td><td>0.0.1.255</td><td>512</td><td>510</td></tr><tr><td>/22</td><td>255.255.252.0</td><td>0.0.3.255</td><td>1,024</td><td>1,022</td></tr><tr><td>/21</td><td>255.255.248.0</td><td>0.0.7.255</td><td>2,048</td><td>2,046</td></tr><tr><td>/20</td><td>255.255.240.0</td><td>0.0.15.255</td><td>4,096</td><td>4,094</td></tr><tr><td>/19</td><td>255.255.224.0</td><td>0.0.31.255</td><td>8,192</td><td>8,190</td></tr><tr><td>/18</td><td>255.255.192.0</td><td>0.0.63.255</td><td>16,384</td><td>16,382</td></tr><tr><td>/17</td><td>255.255.128.0</td><td>0.0.127.255</td><td>32,768</td><td>32,766</td></tr><tr><td>/16</td><td>255.255.0.0</td><td>0.0.255.255</td><td>65,536</td><td>65,534</td></tr><tr><td>/15</td><td>255.254.0.0</td><td>0.1.255.255</td><td>131,072</td><td>131,070</td></tr><tr><td>/14</td><td>255.252.0.0</td><td>0.3.255.255</td><td>262,144</td><td>262,142</td></tr><tr><td>/13</td><td>255.248.0.0</td><td>0.7.255.255</td><td>524,288</td><td>524,286</td></tr><tr><td>/12</td><td>255.240.0.0</td><td>0.15.255.255</td><td>1,048,576</td><td>1,048,574</td></tr><tr><td>/11</td><td>255.224.0.0</td><td>0.31.255.255</td><td>2,097,152</td><td>2,097,150</td></tr><tr><td>/10</td><td>255.192.0.0</td><td>0.63.255.255</td><td>4,194,304</td><td>4,194,302</td></tr><tr><td>/9</td><td>255.128.0.0</td><td>0.127.255.255</td><td>8,388,608</td><td>8,388,606</td></tr><tr><td>/8</td><td>255.0.0.0</td><td>0.255.255.255</td><td>16,777,216</td><td>16,777,214</td></tr><tr><td>/7</td><td>254.0.0.0</td><td>1.255.255.255</td><td>33,554,432</td><td>33,554,430</td></tr><tr><td>/6</td><td>252.0.0.0</td><td>3.255.255.255</td><td>67,108,864</td><td>67,108,862</td></tr><tr><td>/5</td><td>248.0.0.0</td><td>7.255.255.255</td><td>134,217,728</td><td>134,217,726</td></tr><tr><td>/4</td><td>240.0.0.0</td><td>15.255.255.255</td><td>268,435,456</td><td>268,435,454</td></tr><tr><td>/3</td><td>224.0.0.0</td><td>31.255.255.255</td><td>536,870,912</td><td>536,870,910</td></tr><tr><td>/2</td><td>192.0.0.0</td><td>63.255.255.255</td><td>1,073,741,824</td><td>1,073,741,822</td></tr><tr><td>/1</td><td>128.0.0.0</td><td>127.255.255.255</td><td>2,147,483,648</td><td>2,147,483,646</td></tr><tr><td>/0</td><td>0.0.0.0</td><td>255.255.255.255</td><td>4,294,967,296</td><td>4,294,967,294</td></tr></table><br /><br /></div>
