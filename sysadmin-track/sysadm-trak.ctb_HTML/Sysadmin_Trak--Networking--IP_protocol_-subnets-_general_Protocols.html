<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>IP protocol /subnets/ general Protocols</h1><br/>## Parts of a Network Packet<br /><br />Network packets are similar in function to postal packages. A network packet, also known as a unit of data, goes through the process of encapsulation, which adds information to it as it travels toward its destination and marks where it begins and ends.<br /><br />A network packet consists of the following three parts:<br /><br />### 1. IPv4 Packet<br /><br />An IPv4 packet comprises the following components:<br /><br />* **Packet Header**<br />    * **Version**<br />    * **Internet Header Length (IHL)**<br />    * **Type of Service**<br />    * **Total Length**<br />    * **Identification**<br />    * **Flags**<br />    * **Fragment Offset**<br />    * **Time to Live (TTL)**<br />    * **Protocol**<br />    * **Header Checksum**<br />    * **Source Address**<br />    * **Destination Address**<br />    * **Options**<br />* **Payload**<br />* **Trailer**<br /><br />### 2. IPv6<br /><br />IPv6 is the newer version of IPv4, developed in the early 1980s. Despite the introduction and adoption of the modern IPv6, IPv4 still routes most of today&#39;s internet traffic. IPv6 uses different IP headers for data packets, as an IPv6 address is four times larger than an IPv4 address. It&#39;s a more streamlined version of IPv4 and provides better support for real-time traffic by eliminating the fields that are rarely used or unnecessary.<br /><br />### Why use Packets?<br /><br />Packets are used for efficient and reliable transmission of data. Instead of transferring a huge file as a single data block, sending it in smaller packets improves transmission rates. Packets also enable multiple computers to share the same connection. For example, if one person is downloading a file, the computer can send packets to the server, while another user is simultaneously sending packets to the same server.<br /><br />The following are some of the benefits of using packets:<br /><br />* Different paths can be used to route packets to their destination. This process is known as packet switching.<br />* If an error occurs, the packets can be stored and retransmitted later.<br />* Packets use the best route available for delivery, allowing them to be routed across congested parts of the network without slowing them down in a specific spot.<br />* Packets can be encrypted to ensure secure delivery.<br /></div>
